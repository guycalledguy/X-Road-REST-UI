## 2 Installation


### 2.1 Supported Platforms

The security server runs on the following platforms:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3 (RHEL7) or newer operating system on a 64-bit platform. The security server software is distributed as .rpm packages through the official X-Road repository at https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-rpm/
* Ubuntu Server 14.04 and 18.04 Long-Term Support (LTS) operating system. See [IG-SS](ig-ss_x-road_v6_security_server_installation_guide.md) for more information.

The software can be installed both on physical and virtualized hardware (of the latter, Xen and Oracle VirtualBox have been tested).


### 2.2 Reference Data

*Note*: The information in empty cells should be determined before the server’s installation, by the person performing the installation.

**Caution**: Data necessary for the functioning of the operating system is not included.

### 2.3 Requirements for the Security Server

Minimum recommended hardware parameters:

-   the server’s hardware (motherboard, CPU, network interface cards, storage system) must be supported by RHEL7 in general;

-   a 64-bit dual-core Intel, AMD or compatible CPU; AES instruction set support is highly recommended;

-   2 CPU;

-   4 GB RAM;

-   10 GB free disk space (OS partition), 20-40 GB free disk space (`/var` partition);

-   a 100 Mbps network interface card.

Requirements to software and settings:

-   an installed and configured RHEL7 (v7.3 or newer) x86-64 operating system;

-   if the security server is separated from other networks by a firewall and/or NAT, the necessary connections to and from the security server are allowed (**reference data: 1.4; 1.5; 1.6; 1.7**). The enabling of auxiliary services which are necessary for the functioning and management of the operating system (such as DNS, NTP, and SSH) stay outside the scope of this guide;

-   if the security server has a private IP address, a corresponding NAT record must be created in the firewall (**reference data: 1.9**).


### 2.4 Preparing OS

-   Set the operating system locale. Add following line to the `/etc/environment` file.

        LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

-   Install `yum-utils`, a collection of utilities that integrate with yum to extend its native features.

        sudo yum install yum-utils

-   If `/tmp` directory is mounted using `noexec` switch, the admin UI does not start, because it uses `/tmp` directory. 
    Check is `/tmp` directory mounted using `noexec` switch:

        mount | grep /tmp

    Does the output contain `/tmp` and `noexec`?
    
        /dev/loop0 on /tmp type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)

    If yes, then `noexec` switch must be removed modifying `/etc/fstab` file. In addition, the directory must be mounted again to make the changes effective immediately:
    
        mount -o remount,exec /tmp


### 2.5 Installation

To install the X-Road security server software on *RHEL7* operating system, follow these steps.

1.  Add X-Road package repository (**reference data: 1.1**) and Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository:

        sudo yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
        sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-release-rpm/rhel/7/current

    The following packages are fetched from EPEL: `crudini`, `rlwrap` ja `nginx`.

2.  Add the X-Road repository’s signing key to the list of trusted keys (**reference data: 1.2**):

        sudo rpm --import https://artifactory.niis.org/api/gpg/key/public

3.  Issue the following command to install the security server packages (use package xroad-securityserver-ee to include configuration specific to Estonia; use package xroad-securityserver-fi to include configuration specific to Finland):

        sudo yum install xroad-securityserver

4. Add system user (**reference data: 1.3**) whom all roles in the user interface are granted to. Add a new user with the command
   
        sudo xroad-add-admin-user <username>
   
   User roles are discussed in detail in X-Road Security Server User Guide \[[UG-SS](#Ref_UG-SS)\].

5. Once the installation is completed, start the security server

        sudo systemctl start xroad-proxy


### 2.6 Post-Installation Checks

The installation is successful if system services are started and the user interface is responding.

-   Ensure from the command line that X-Road services are in the `running` state (example output follows):

        sudo systemctl | grep xroad

        xroad-confclient.service  loaded active running  X-Road confclient
        xroad-jetty9.service      loaded active running  X-Road Jetty server
        xroad-monitor.service     loaded active running  X-Road Monitor
        xroad-proxy.service       loaded active running  X-Road Proxy
        xroad-signer.service      loaded active running  X-Road signer

-   Ensure that the security server user interface at https://SECURITYSERVER:4000/ (**reference data: 1.8; 1.6**) can be opened in a Web browser. To log in, use the account name chosen during the installation (**reference data: 1.3**). While the user interface is still starting up, the Web browser may display the “502 Bad Gateway” error.


### 2.7 Installing the Support for Hardware Tokens

Hardware security tokens (smartcard, USB token, Hardware Security Module) have not been tested on RHEL7. Therefore, support is not provided.


### 2.8 Installing the Support for Environmental Monitoring

The support for environmental monitoring functionality on a security server is provided by package xroad-monitor that is installed by default. The package installs and starts the `xroad-monitor` process that will gather and make available the monitoring information.


## 3 Security Server Initial Configuration

During the security server initial configuration, the server’s X-Road membership information and the software token’s PIN are set.


### 3.1 Prerequisites

Configuring the security server assumes that the security server owner is a member of the X-Road.


### 3.2 Reference Data

ATTENTION: Reference items 2.1 - 2.3 in the reference data are provided to the security server owner by the X-Road central’s administrator.

The security server code and the software token’s PIN will be determined during the installation at the latest, by the person performing the installation.

 Ref  |                                                   | Explanation
 ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------
 2.1  | &lt;global configuration anchor file&gt; or &lt;URL&gt; | Global configuration anchor file
 2.2  | E.g.<br>GOV - government<br> COM - commercial     | Member class of the security server's owner
 2.3  | &lt;security server owner register code&gt;       | Member code of the security server's owner
 2.4  | &lt;choose security server identificator name&gt; | Security server's code
 2.5  | &lt;choose PIN for software token&gt;             | Software token’s PIN


### 3.3 Configuration

To perform the initial configuration, open the address

    https://SECURITYSERVER:4000/

in a Web browser (**reference data: 1.8; 1.6**). To log in, use the account name chosen during the installation (**reference data: 1.3).**

Upon first log-in, the system asks for the following information.

-   The global configuration anchor file (**reference data: 2.1**).

    **Please verify anchor hash value with the published value.**

If the configuration is successfully downloaded, the system asks for the following information.

-   The security server owner’s member class (**reference data: 2.2**).

-   The security server owner’s member code (**reference data: 2.3**).
    If the member class and member code are correctly entered, the system displays the security server owner’s name as registered in the X-Road center.

-   Security server code (**reference data: 2.4**), which is chosen by the security server administrator and which has to be unique across all the security servers belonging to the same X-Road member.

-   Software token’s PIN (**reference data: 2.5**). The PIN will be used to protect the keys stored in the software token. The PIN must be stored in a secure place, because it will be no longer possible to use or recover the private keys in the token once the PIN has been lost.


## 4 Installation Error handling

### 4.1 UI Does Not Respond or Returns an Error Message

-    Open `/etc/xroad/nginx/default-xroad.conf` file using your favourite text editor.

     Change the following line:

         proxy pass http://localhost:8083
     
     to
     
         proxy pass http://127.0.0.1:8083
     
     Save the changes and restart Nginx:
    
         systemctl restart nginx
